1
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
Sharpening blades in dreams of terror

2
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,539
Your fury is what you are

3
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,860
Increasing lust of a living hate

4
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,500
Again an again in a physical pain

5
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,200
Her profanation's ready

6
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,240
*The sacrifice is on its way*

7
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,160
The resonating screams arise

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,800
Until she dies, in her own blood

9
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,260
She's drowning down

10
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,220
*You* Can't escape from your own nature

11
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,780
Forever's who you are!

12
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,000
Drain all her will to resist whitout any respect

13
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,560
The scars you've done will be impressed like a mark on her back

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,340
A desecration's coming

15
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,120
*The eyes you've never seen are closed*

16
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,000
The sound of her breath drifts away

17
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,280
Forever gone

18
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,140
Burn!

19
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,780
Forever burn

20
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,520
-All her dreams-

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:31,460
-She feels lost and facing the insanity-

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,120
*We're lost in this pain*

23
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,359
-Her whisper is fading away-

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,239
-Destiny won't forgive-

25
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,740
*Won't* forgive the one who lead to the unmerciful fate!

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,040
Pray all your gods to be saved

27
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,440
You can not liberate

28
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,520
Your wicked soul from the dread of a tragical fate

29
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,120
«Our inquisition is coming to punish your life»

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
The sound of her scream makes you mad

31
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,640
The sin is done

32
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,020
Stalking preys with frantic sadism

33
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,540
Your evil's satisfied

34
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,740
Incoming will to devastate

35
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,660
Again an again in a critical haze

36
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,240
The snow white skin is burning

37
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,220
*Impurity for all to see*

38
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,940
Her shattered body is on the ground

39
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,900
Until she dies, In her own blood

40
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,020
She's drowning down

41
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,140
*You* Can't escape from your own nature

42
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,800
Forever's who you are!

43
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,460
Forever burn

44
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,840
-All her dreams-

45
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,520
-She feels lost and facing the insanity-

46
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
*We're lost in this pain*

47
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,820
-Her whisper is fading away-

48
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,540
Destiny won't forgive

49
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,300
*Won't* forgive the one who lead to the unmerciful fate!

50
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,720
For this crime you'll be trapped in our cage

51
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,480
And again you'll be slave to the rage

52
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,159
We will impose the sentence of your death

53
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,300
For your demise

54
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,920
While you beg for a mercy denied

55
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,580
We'll be deaf and our purification will be blind

56
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,760
This violation will condamn to die
