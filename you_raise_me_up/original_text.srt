1
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:11,785
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary

2
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:20,524
When troubles come 
and my heart burdened be

3
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:29,080
Then, I am still 
and wait here in the silence

4
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:37,939
Until you come and sit awhile with me

5
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:45,901
You raise me up, 
so I can stand on mountains

6
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:55,180
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas

7
00:00:55,852 --> 00:01:03,769
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders

8
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:12,370
You raise me up... To more than I can be

9
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:14,191
(Ooo...)

10
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:53,434
You raise me up, 
so I can stand on mountains

11
00:01:53,941 --> 00:02:02,762
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas

12
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:10,414
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders

13
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:20,627
You raise me up... To more than I can be

14
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:29,557
You raise me up, 
so I can stand on mountains

15
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:31,140
(Stand on mountains)

16
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:39,387
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
(Stormy seas)

17
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:46,933
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
(I am strong. Ooo)

18
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:54,981
You raise me up... To more than I can be

19
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,891
You raise me up, 
(Raise me)

20
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:02,819
So I can stand on mountains
(Raise me, raise me up)

21
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:11,400
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
(You raise me up)

22
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:19,108
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders

23
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:28,881
You raise me up... To more than I can be

24
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:46,391
You raise me up... To more than I can be

25
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:54,734
Bind me not to the pasture

26
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:59,678
Chain me not to the plow

27
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:08,070
Set me free to find my calling
