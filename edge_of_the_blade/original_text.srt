1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,680
(Edge of the blade)

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,840
Time to break through the anger

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,759
Hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,439
Incinerating hands that touched your graceful face

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,800
In their mysterious ways

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,180
The scorching scars have left an everlasting visual trace

7
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,340
Now they're blinding, and rewinding

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:46,840
(Edge of the blade)

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,860
Time to break through the anger

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,020
Hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,840
Cherish your hunger for resentment and dismay

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,320
And then come out to play

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,820
Cascading colours, meticulously all washed away

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,740
Time for choosing not for losing

15
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:25,280
Defying the fire reviving within

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,140
Time to break through

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Your walls are soaring high

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,480
They are disarranging

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,880
The surface on which we build our own lie

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,759
(Edge of the blade)

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,560
Time to break through the anger

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,440
Hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,880
Your wish for virtual perfection seems inane

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,680
But try and you will evolve

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,839
Your paragon possessed your inner self to no avail

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,480
No more waiting, no debating

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:33,360
Defying the fire reviving within

28
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,480
Time to break through
Your walls are soaring high

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,360
They are disarranging

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,760
The surface on which we build our own lie

31
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
Don't throw your life away

32
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,960
Remain the same

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,040
Watch your back,
now feel the heat

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
You've fooled the world

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,600
one more time

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
And now that you've seen

37
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,560
with open eyes

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,720
All of us are incomplete

39
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,000
It's time to break through

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,680
Your walls are soaring high

41
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,840
You can even try to

42
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,640
Break through the perfect state of mind

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,079
And now you break through

44
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,360
You'll reach beyond the sky

45
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:10,200
You should never,
ever build on the surface made of lies

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,920
(Edge of the blade)

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,359
Time to break through the anger

48
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,920
Hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth
