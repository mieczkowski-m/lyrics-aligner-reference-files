1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,800
The sky is a neighborhood

2
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,066
So keep it down

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:28,466
The heart is a storybook

4
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,733
A star burned out

5
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:34,733
The sky is a neighborhood

6
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:39,033
Don't make a sound

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Lights coming up ahead

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,566
Don't look now

9
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:49,566
The sky is a neighborhood

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,800
The sky is a neighborhood

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,565
Don't look now

12
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh my dear
Heaven is a big bang now

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,733
Gotta get to sleep somehow

14
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:12,166
Banging on the ceiling,
banging on the ceiling

15
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:15,899
Keep it down

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,433
Oh my dear
Heaven is a big bang now

17
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:22,933
Gotta get to sleep somehow

18
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,533
Banging on the ceiling,
banging on the ceiling

19
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:31,166
Keep it down

20
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:38,366
My mind is a battlefield
All hope is gone

21
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:43,933
Trouble to the right and left
Whose side you on?

22
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,866
Thoughts like a minefield

23
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:52,033
I'm a ticking bomb

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,766
Maybe you should watch
your step

25
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:58,533
Don't get lost

26
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:02,600
The sky is a neighborhood

27
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:10,532
The sky is a neighborhood

28
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:14,166
Don't get lost

29
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:18,666
Oh my dear
Heaven is a big bang now

30
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,333
Gotta get to sleep somehow

31
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,833
Banging on the ceiling,
banging on the ceiling

32
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,533
Keep it down

33
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:33,100
Oh my dear
Heaven is a big bang now

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,632
Gotta get to sleep somehow

35
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,233
Banging on the ceiling,
banging on the ceiling

36
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,766
Keep it down

37
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:45,700
The sky is a neighborhood

38
00:02:54,633 --> 00:03:02,000
Heart is a storybook
The star burned out

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,333
Something coming up ahead
Don't look now

40
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:14,900
Oh my dear
Heaven is a big bang now

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,466
Gotta get to sleep somehow

42
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:21,166
Banging on the ceiling,
banging on the ceiling

43
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,733
Keep it down

44
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh my dear
Heaven is a big bang now

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,766
Gotta get to sleep somehow

46
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:35,333
Banging on the ceiling,
banging on the ceiling

47
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,900
Keep it down

48
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,033
The sky is a neighborhood

49
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:43,366
Oh my dear
Heaven is a big bang now

50
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:46,133
Gotta get to sleep somehow

51
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:49,566
Banging on the ceiling,
banging on the ceiling

52
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:52,566
Keep it down

53
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,000
The sky is a neighborhood
