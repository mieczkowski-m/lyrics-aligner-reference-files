1
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,700
-Ohh,
Bright son of destiny-

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:04,400
-Bringer of light in this darkness-

3
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,340
-Beautiful prince-

4
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,660
-Now take my hand again-

5
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:22,540
-Forever tied by the thread of our fate-

6
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,500
-Now, we're together again-

7
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,860
Cold and desolate is the nature of my soul

8
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,720
Forever indifferent to the screams of shadows

9
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,840
Lying deep in the void

10
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,380
So give it up

11
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,580
Now face the score

12
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,820
In the heart of the chosen one

13
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,720
There's no deliverance!

14
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,559
«I have to face all this scorn»

15
00:02:51,660 --> 00:03:01,000
«Staining my own land with useless tears»

16
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,600
«Look in the eyes of the one»

17
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:20,200
«Feeding himself with my deepest fears»

18
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,840
-Ohh,
I'll touch your heart again-

19
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:38,240
-Waken the cold lonely dreamer-

20
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,600
-I, will illuminate your soul-

21
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,300
-Wounded by emptiness-

22
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:57,180
-Please take me far from this land of pain-

23
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,620
-Now, on the waves of the sea-

24
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,520
Cold and desolate is the nature of my soul

25
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,740
Forever indifferent to the screams of shadows

26
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,799
Lying deep in the void

27
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,140
So give it up

28
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,079
Now face the score

29
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,399
In the heart of the chosen one

30
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,280
There's no deliverance!

31
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,540
I had to face all this scorn

32
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:14,600
Staining my own land with useless tears

33
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:23,720
Look,
Now I am too tired to fight

34
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:35,000
And run away from this filling light!

35
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,340
*Nightmares and shadows*

36
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,520
*Together we'll drown in the sea*

37
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,180
Believe me!

38
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,060
You'll walk by my side!
