1
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,119
Welcome to the nightmare
where villains wear the crowns

2
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,900
Fools rule a broken world
and fear grows all around

3
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,720
There's a bad king
A dreadful puppet on a string

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,440
He pretends to be a champion
of the common man

5
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,120
Wants more division
in his lost and riven land

6
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:53,019
He plays with real lives
in the darkest game of life

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,920
His greedy eyes

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,000
Looks insane, frozen smile like he's in pain

9
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,860
He doesn't count

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,000
The human cost but only money made or lost

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,880
King for a day
He kills the truth and looks away

12
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,700
King for a day
Lives like the world would end today

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,900
King for a day
What do you hide, why do you lie?

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,640
Who made the rules for this game?

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,740
Who is paying your champagne?

16
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,760
All the mercy in the world
cannot save you anymore
King for a day

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,180
He knows how to justify
and how to feed the myths

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,880
How to glorify
the lies and hide the truth

19
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,699
He talks a lot but
his mouth is full of empty words

20
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,680
He has the right friends
making shady inside deals

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,220
Before the story ends
we will be out of tears

22
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:29,080
Fools give the answer
wise men don't even try

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,500
The time has come

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,480
To dethrone him but there's a new clone
stepping in

25
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,000
Just more scum

26
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,959
Another greedy, rotten puppet on a string

27
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,320
King for a day
He kills the truth and looks away

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,880
King for a day
Lives like the world would end today

29
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,400
King for a day
What do you hide, why do you lie?

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,680
Who made the rules for this game?

31
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,060
Who is paying your champagne?

32
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,100
All the mercy in the world
cannot save you anymore
King for a day

33
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,359
I own the seas

34
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,620
I have the Earth on its knees

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,340
Give me another day

36
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,080
And I'll take your future away

37
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,140
Just vote for me - again

38
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,320
King for a day
he kills the truth and looks away

39
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,559
King for a day
lives like the world would end today

40
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,480
King for a day
What do you hide, why do you lie?

41
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,860
Who made the rules for this game?

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,100
Who is paying your champagne?

43
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,520
All the mercy in the world
cannot save you anymore
King for a day
