1
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:53,360
Archaean horizon

2
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:05,320
The first sunrise

3
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:16,940
On a pristine Gaea

4
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,580
Opus perfectum

5
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,680
Somewhere there,

6
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,980
us sleeping

7
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,980
After sleeping through a hundred million centuries

8
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,880
We have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet

9
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,000
Sparkling with color, bountiful with life

10
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,280
Within decades we must close our eyes again

11
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,619
Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun

12
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,680
to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it?

13
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,860
The cosmic law of gravity

14
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,100
Pulled the newborns around a fire

15
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,479
A careless, cold infinity in every vast direction

16
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,520
Lonely farer in the Goldilocks zone

17
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,340
She has a tale to tell

18
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,480
From the stellar nursery into a carbon feast

19
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,120
Enter LUCA

20
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,420
The tapestry of chemistry

21
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,000
There's a writing in the garden

22
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,920
Leading us to the Mother of all

23
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,680
We are one

24
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,860
We are a universe

25
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,640
Forebears of what will be

26
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,780
scions of the Devonian sea

27
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,280
Aeons pass,

28
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,039
writing the tale of us all

29
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,300
A day-to-day new opening

30
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,180
For the greatest show on Earth

31
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,940
Ion channels welcoming the outside world

32
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,340
to the stuff of stars

33
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,960
Bedding the tree of a biological holy

34
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,200
Enter life

35
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,340
The tapestry of chemistry

36
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,400
There's a writing in the garden

37
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,140
Leading us to the mother of all

38
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,220
We are one

39
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,640
We are a universe

40
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,380
Forebears of what will be

41
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,880
Scions of the Devonian sea

42
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,979
Aeons pass

43
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,860
Writing the tale of us all

44
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,480
A day-to-day new opening

45
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,659
For the greatest show on Earth

46
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,180
We are here to care for the garden

47
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,359
The wonder of birth

48
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,880
Of every form most beautiful

49
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,740
Every form most beautiful

50
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,880
We are one

51
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,120
We are a universe

52
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,840
Forebears of what will be

53
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,200
Scions of the Devonian sea

54
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:00,500
Aeons pass writing the tale of us all

55
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,160
A day-to-day new opening

56
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,480
For the greatest show on Earth

57
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,200
After a billion years, the show is still here

58
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,340
Not a single one of your fathers died young

59
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,180
The handy travelers out of Africa

60
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,920
Little Lucy of the Afar

61
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,300
Gave birth to fantasy

62
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,240
To idolatry

63
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,640
To self-destructive weaponry

64
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,140
Enter the God of gaps

65
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,439
Deep within the past

66
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,980
Atavistic dread of the hunted

67
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,400
Enter Ionia, the cradle of thought

68
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,220
The architecture of understanding

69
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,640
The human lust to feel so exceptional

70
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,880
To rule the Earth

71
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,280
Hunger for shiny rocks

72
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,620
For giant mushroom clouds

73
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,200
The will to do just as you'd be done by

74
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,140
Enter history, the grand finale

75
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,980
Enter ratkind

76
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,140
Man, he took his time in the sun

77
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,120
Had a dream to understand

78
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,200
A single grain of sand

79
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,760
He gave birth to poetry

80
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,680
But one day'll cease to be

81
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,459
Greet the last light of the library

82
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,340
Man, he took his time in the sun

83
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,860
Had a dream to understand

84
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,460
A single grain of sand

85
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,620
He gave birth to poetry

86
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,220
But one day'll cease to be

87
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,580
Greet the last light of the library

88
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,180
Man, he took his time in the sun

89
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,500
Had a dream to understand

90
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,220
A single grain of sand

91
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,320
He gave birth to poetry

92
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,880
But one day'll cease to be

93
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,319
Greet the last light of the library

94
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,540
Please sing with us

95
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,600
We were here!

96
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,720
We were here!

97
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,459
Range your voices up with the band please and down here everybody as loud as you can

98
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,579
We were here!

99
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,620
A big one coming

100
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,420
We were here!

101
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,700
And the last one

102
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:28,120
We were here!

103
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,660
We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones

104
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,079
Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born

105
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,180
The potential people who could have been here in my place

106
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,220
But who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara

107
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:26,079
Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton

108
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:32,900
We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA

109
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,020
So massively exceeds the set of actual people

110
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,440
In the teeth of those stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here

111
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,340
We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds

112
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,200
How dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state

113
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,360
From which the vast majority have never stirred?"

114
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:56,200
Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death

115
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:07,500
the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows

116
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
There is grandeur in this view of life

117
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:20,120
with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;

118
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,380
and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on

119
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,020
according to the fixed law of gravity

120
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,080
from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful

121
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:52,600
and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.
