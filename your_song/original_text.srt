1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,480
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,320
That I put down in words

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:20,020
How wonderful life is
 now you're in the world

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,480
I sat on the roof and I kicked off the moss

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,460
Well some of these verses, well they

6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,699
They've got me quite cross

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,760
But the sun's been kind while I wrote this song

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:52,720
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,200
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,640
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue

11
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,360
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean

12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:23,660
Yours are the sweetest eyes, I've ever seen

13
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:38,000
And you can tell everbody this is your song

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,060
It may be quite simple but now that it's done

15
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,740
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

16
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,119
That I put down in words

17
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:07,220
How wonderful life is, now you're in the world
