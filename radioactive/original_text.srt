1
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,620
I’m waking up

2
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,720
To ash and dust

3
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,100
I wipe my brow and sweat my rust

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,440
I’m breathing in the chemicals

5
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,820
I’m breaking in and shaping up

6
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,540
Then checking out on the prison bus

7
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,740
This is it, the apocalypse

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,740
Oh, oh, oh

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,339
I’m waking up

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,660
I feel it in my bones

11
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,860
Enough to make my system blow

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,420
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,480
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

15
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,640
I’m radioactive

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,600
Radioactive

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,640
I’m radioactive

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,500
Radioactive

21
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,179
I’m breaking in and shaping up

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,420
Then checking out on the prison bus

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,320
This is it, the apocalypse

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,720
I'm waking up

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,500
I feel it in my bones

27
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,980
Enough to make my system blow

28
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,820
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

29
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,500
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

31
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,420
I’m radioactive

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,260
Radioactive

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,320
I’m radioactive

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,480
Radioactive

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,320
All systems go

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,399
The sun hasn’t died

38
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,680
Deep in my bones

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
Straight from inside

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,880
I feel it in my bones

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
Enough to make my system blow

42
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,980
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,680
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

45
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,400
I’m radioactive

47
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,620
Radioactive

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,600
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,040
I’m radioactive

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,900
Radioactive
